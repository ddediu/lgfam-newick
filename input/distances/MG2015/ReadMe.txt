This R script computes a generalization of the "genetic distance" between languages as defined originally in 
	Maurits, L. & Griffiths, T.L. (2015) Tracing the roots of syntax with Bayesian phylogenetics, PNAS 111 (37):13576--13581
section Materials and Methods, subsection Constructing trees, page 13580.
The generalization is to allow any hierarchical classification (not just the Ethnologue) and any alpha (by default set to the reported value of 0.69); for languages from diferent families the distance is set to NA.
